# Steering using Lanes 


The hough lines obtained is differentiated into left and right lanes depending on their slopes.

if the slope is less than zero left lane

if the slope is grater than zero right lane

appending lines into arrays

left line => left array
right line => right array

A polynomial curve fitting these lines is passed through these arrays
